# Be patient
It is supposed to be hard to understand `legacy code`. By definition it is the code that is supposed to be hard to understand. So be patient.

# Document
If the code is not documented, this is the best time to save time and effort of the future team by spending time documenting it.

## How to:
1. If you don't understand something, ask someone who might. If you don't understand something, chances are the future guy won't too. So write it somewhere. 
2. If the team uses internal keywords for easy and faster communication, document it to make the future simpler.
3. Comment the code wherever you think there should've been a comment.
4. Rename the variables if you think they should be renamed.
