# Recreating a new system won't work
If you think of a solution where you decide to write a completely new version of the current app, that won't work. You will end up in stall in terms of features until the new system is comletely up and running, while you'll be fixing bugs in both new and old version. This is too risky for large industry codes.

# Ship of Thesus plan
* Old code is the new code. Users would be using the new systems which would refer to the old code until that specific behaviour is re-written.
* Re-implement each behaviour to the new code-base while keeping it same for the end user.
* Eventually you'll be left with no old code and all new code.
