# Mikado Method 
## Steps
1. Get a piece of paper
2. Set the goal and write on paper, start at center
3. Set the time to achieve and try to complete the goal in said time
	* If failed:
		* Revert and start fresh
		* Think what is missing, divide the goal into subgoals and write it on the paper
		* Repeat from 3
	* If completed:
		* Repeat from 3 with a new subgoal

## Notes
* Small timeframes
* Start fresh if you fail
* Commit when goal achieved
