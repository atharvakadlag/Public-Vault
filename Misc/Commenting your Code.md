# JavaDoc is of little use
JavaDoc style commments take up a lot of space and tell you very little about what is actually happening. Use of JavaDoc can be eliminated by using self-descriptive variable/function names.

# When to comment
Whenever you feel that a **why** is necessary, you should comment. 
A small method that does complicated stuff by calling some not-so-popular inbuilt function, mention why you did that. 
Using a complex regex when a similar simpler one exists, explain why you didn't use a simpler one.

*Focus on why and not what.*

*If understanding a comment is more complicated and time consuming than rewriting the code, rewrite it.* 

*Good logging can help you explain codes*
