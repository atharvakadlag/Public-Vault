# Writing a pull request
1. Mention the purpose of the pull request
	eg. *This implements concurrency in the searching query*
2. Mention the reason for existance of the purpose
	eg. *Search query costed 560 ms of time on every call which reduced the efficiency. Implementing concurrency reduces the time to 100ms thereby reduc
	ing runtime by 300%.*
3. Write about what you expect from the reader, eg.
	*discuss about the technical approach*, *is there a simpler way to do it*, *do you see any security flaw*
	Also mention when you want the feedback. Mention the specific people by @mention if you want a specific feedback
	eg. *@github/security any security flaw in this?*
# Feedback on a pull request
